Status Quo:
In today’s digital age, platforms like social media, messaging apps, and virtual meeting spaces dominate our interactions. Although they offer convenience, they also create an overreliance on digital communication, and this dependency is reshaping how we interact and it is eroding essential social skills. Digital addiction is making genuine, nuanced conversations more fragmented and shallow. My main arguments will be about the imperfections of digital communication methods, while my colleague Aistė will expand on the negative psychological effects.

Argument:
One of the most significant impacts of digital addiction is the loss of subtleties inherent in natural communication. Face-to-face interaction is complex and has a lot of layers, so to say. It includes tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language - all of which are critical for truly understanding and connecting with others. Digital platforms strip away these elements, reducing communication to simple text, emojis, and occasional video calls. While some people might bring up emojis, gifs and so on, this {arg}. 

Moreover, without tone indicators or non-verbal cues, it becomes difficult to understand sincerity, sarcasm, or emotion. For example, saying “I’m fine” in person could be interpreted differently based on facial expressions or tone, but in a text, the true emotion behind the words is often unclear. Emojis and GIFs attempt to substitute for this, but, as I mentioned before, they are oversimplified and incapable of capturing the complexity of human interaction. To sum up, loss of subtlties creates a communication gap where misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and emotional disconnection thrive. 

Examples:
Scientific studies support this issue. American Journal of Sociology found that increased use of digital communication correlates with a decline in the ability to interpret facial expressions and vocal tones. This is particularly concerning for children and adolescents, who are in critical stages of social development and need healthy communication for their social skills.

In the real world, this was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Video meeting tools like Zoom became lifelines, but even then, many reported feeling what was called “Zoom fatigue.” A 2021 study called [Nonverbal Overload: A Theoretical Argument for the Causes of Zoom Fatigue] explained that this fatigue was partly due to the lack of natural non-verbal communication cues, such as hand gestures and peripheral vision. It’s a testament to how much we rely on face-to-face interactions for effective communication.

Conclusion:
The nuances of in-person communication are irreplaceable, yet digital addiction makes us increasingly detached from them. As we switch to screens over real-world conversations, we lose the ability to interpret subtleties, form genuine connections, and express ourselves effectively. While technology will undoubtedly remain central to our lives, striking a balance between digital and face-to-face communication is essential to preserve social skills.
