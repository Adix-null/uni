[Introduction]
Despite significant advancements in gender equality, women in STEM still face pervasive undervaluation compared to their male counterparts. My argument today will underscore the systemic barriers that discourage women to pursue careers in STEM, while my colleague Pijus will emphasize the sistemic disparity and unjust treatment in academia.
[Argument]
A study published in 2021 by the Journal of Neuroscience research describes the following three factors that likely contribute to gender inequalities and women's departure from academic STEM fields: numeric underrepresentation and stereotypes, lack of supportive social networks and chilly academic climates. 
[Example]
A problem for gender equality in STEM faces is the exclusion of genders. Institutes made specifically for women in an attempt to break cultural gender roles often undermine the concept of gender equality by implying that this is an exception, and not the status quo. They not only reinforce the idea that women in STEM need some sort of special treatment, but they also divert funding that could be spent fixing the root cause - a toxic workplace culture. And this has been proven to be an inadequate solution - the Equality Action Center at the University of California has consistently found that while while women’s initiatives may initially boost interest and participation in STEM, they often don’t impact long-term retention.
[Example]
Another aformentioned factor is a lack of support networks together with unwelcoming academic environments. Research from the Society of Women Engineers and Technology indicates that without structural support, such as professional mentorship, equitable access to helpful resources, and gender-sensitive policies, women are often forced to navigate workplace challenges alone. This of course leads to high rates of career dissatisfaction and attrition. Moreover, women in STEM benefit most from a culture of inclusion and leadership support, not just simple entry-level programs. Without a thorough support system that includes continuous career guidance, role models, and fair feedback, women’s participation in STEM often remains limited to entry positions rather than long-term success​ful careers.
[Conclusion]
In conclusion, the undervaluation of women in STEM fosters an unfriendly, often toxic environment that discourages talent and innovation. The wrong focus of women-only institutes does not properly adress pervasive biases and gendered expectations that create a culture where women are not only undervalued but also made to feel unwelcome in their own field. This environment stifles their contributions and denies STEM the full breadth of perspectives and skills necessary for progress.
