Thank you Daimonas.

Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and is projected to significantly contribute to the overall global burden of disease by 2030. Research on depression among college students has gained increasing attention in recent years. This is not surprising since college years are a critical transition period for students as they become adults, which is often accompanied by a variety of challenges as students at this stage are susceptible to a variety of mental disorders. And as the video mentioned, a big part of stress is everyday, workplace situations. All of these risk factors of course necesitates an effective managment strategy, which can be accomplished by a professional help from institutions.
This stress can be lessened by using mediation anxiety symptoms. In a 2022 study by the journal of Psychology Research and Behavior Management focusing on Chinese college students has found that recognizing anxiety and hopelessess symptoms early could significantly and positively predict both depressive and hopelessness situations in students' life. By frequently monitoring the mental health of students the aforementioned negative symptoms reduced on a monthly basis by a significant amount.
To sum up, it is consistent with the hypothesis that academic stress may contribute to depressive symptoms directly or indirectly through three different indirect pathways: through the mediating role of anxiety symptoms, through the mediating role of hopelessness, and through the chain mediating role of both anxiety symptoms and hopelessnes. In this context, it is critical to help college students control the anxiety level that is caused by academic stress, in order to prevent and alleviate the symptoms of depression disorders. So an institutional aproach to stress managment is definitely possible along with other paths.

Thank you for listening.
