Thank you, Aaron.
    The success of a tech startup hinges not only on innovation and execution but also on the broader economic environment and the ecosystem that supports growth. Favorable economic circumstances, such as access to capital, a stable market, and robust consumer demand, provide a strong foundation for startups to thrive. Additionally, a supportive environment, startup-friendly regulations, and collaborative ecosystems, fosters innovation and scalability. Without these external enablers, even the most promising startups may struggle to achieve sustainable success.
    Timing, as mentioned in the video, is a major factor and our startup is at the right period in time to scale effectively. With the everincreasing use of the internet and IOT devices having a fast, real time access is becoming more important. 
    Although timing is the most important, it is also neccessary to remember that How start-upâ€™s performance depends on the stage of growth that it is in due {18th question}, due to the various outside factors, such as a comfortable growth environment. As described by the study "Success Factors of Startups in the EU", "the linear relationships in failing companies shown point to deficit of: first, human capital and human resources; second, the trust to standards, regulations, legal system; and third, to the deficit of market regulation. ... we conclude that in catching-up European countries, the economic factors of institutional competitiveness, both formal and informal, need to be improved in terms of their quality and level, to boost startup development".
    In conclusion, the success and performance of a tech startup are deeply intertwined with the timing of its market entry and the stage of growth it is navigating. While the right timing can unlock unprecedented opportunities, ensuring a supportive environment and addressing critical factors like human capital, regulatory trust, and market competitiveness is equally essential. As the study highlights, deficiencies in these areas can hinder startup development, particularly in regions striving to catch up economically. By aligning strategic growth with favorable economic conditions and institutional support, startups can maximize their potential for long-term success.
    Now Gustas will tell us about the reasons for the failure of startups.
